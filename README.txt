What is this stuff?

My dev environment config files for MediaWiki, "production-like" in the
ways that I care.

None of this is meant to be secure.

None of this is meant to work for anyone else. Heck, it barely works for me.

It is meant to be stashed in a repo someplace that I can grab a copy, if
all my local backups fail.

Some of the cruft in these files is for wikis that I set up for testing over a
decade ago, and stopped using at least a year ago, and have never tested
again after two reinstalls of my OS and a move to a new laptop. You have
been warned.
